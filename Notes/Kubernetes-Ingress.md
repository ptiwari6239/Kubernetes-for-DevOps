Kubernetes Ingress is a powerful tool that enables external access to services running in a Kubernetes cluster. It acts as a layer 7 load balancer and provides a way to route incoming traffic to different services based on the request's URL path or domain name.

In essence, Ingress acts as a gateway between the outside world and Kubernetes services. It provides a centralized point of control for routing traffic to different services and enables features like SSL termination, load balancing, and path-based routing.

To use Ingress, you need to deploy an Ingress controller, which is responsible for implementing the Ingress rules and directing traffic to the appropriate services. Popular Ingress controllers include NGINX, Traefik, and Istio.
