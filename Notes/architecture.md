# K8s components
A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of worker machines, called nodes, that run containerized applications. Every cluster has at least one worker node.</br>
The worker node(s) host the Pods that are the components of the application workload. 

## control plane components

The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new pod when a deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied).

### kube-apiserver
The kube-api server is the central hub of the Kubernetes cluster that exposes the Kubernetes API.
End users, and other cluster components, talk to the cluster via the API server. Very rarely monitoring systems and third-party services may talk to API servers to interact with the cluster.
So when you use kubectl to manage the cluster, at the backend you are actually communicating with the API server through HTTP REST APIs.
### Etcd

Kubernetes is a distributed system and it needs an efficient distributed database like etcd that supports its distributed nature. It acts as both a backend service discovery and a database.
1. etcd stores all configurations, states, and metadata of Kubernetes objects (pods, secrets, daemonsets, deployments, configmaps, statefulsets, etc).
2. etcd allows a client to subscribe to events using Watch() API . Kubernetes api-server uses the etcdâ€™s watch functionality to track the change in the state of an object.
3. etcd exposes key-value API using gRPC. Also, the gRPC gateway is a RESTful proxy that translates all the HTTP API calls into gRPC messages. It makes it an ideal database for Kubernetes.
4. etcd stores all objects under the /registry directory key in key-value format. For example, information on a pod named Nginx in the default namespace can be found under /registry/pods/default/nginx
   
### kube-scheduler
Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.
</br>
Factors taken into account for scheduling decisions include: individual and collective resource requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, inter-workload interference, and deadlines.

### kube-controller-manager
Controllers are programs that run infinite control loops. Meaning it runs continuously and watches the actual and desired state of objects. If there is a difference in the actual and desired state, it ensures that the kubernetes resource/object is in the desired state.</br>
Kube controller manager is a component that manages all the Kubernetes controllers. Kubernetes resources/objects like pods, namespaces, jobs, replicaset are managed by respective controllers. Also, the kube scheduler is also a controller managed by Kube controller manager.

## Worker-Node Components   
### Kubectl
An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod.

The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet doesn't manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes.

### kube-proxy
kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept.

kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.

kube-proxy uses the operating system packet filtering layer if there is one and it's available. Otherwise, kube-proxy forwards the traffic itself.

### Container Runtime
A fundamental component that empowers Kubernetes to run containers effectively. It is responsible for managing the execution and lifecycle of containers within the Kubernetes environment.

Kubernetes supports container runtimes such as containerd, CRI-O
